WIKI project page
this is the first of what will hopefully be many project pages that hopefully come to fruition.
I am not good at completing personal projects. I lose interest too quickly, and without any true deadline or necessity, they fall by the wayside. if ever I choose to resume it, I have either forgotten what everything does, or since found better ways of doing the same things, and I have to start again from scratch.
the goal of these project pages is to organize ressources, ideas, thoughts, thought processes, research, and work into something managable and easy to remember and pick up after a period of inactivity.
the idea is to put it in a wiki, an easily editable web page or series of web pages. this way, it will be accessible from anywhere (with an internet connection) and at all times (when my server computer is on). this will also allow for others to contribute if they ever so choose.
there is one catch: it doesn't exist yet. so first on my order of business is to create it, and get it up and running.
unfortunately, it is no different than any other project (except that its end result should help all other projects), and has already been set aside at least once before. hopefully, with this page, I'll be able to avoid starting from scratch when I come back to it.

FORMAT/DESIGN OF PAGES
- tentative index page
	- currently, the full-on workhorse page of the wiki

	- on ?page=... , it accesses the desired page
	- links to "edit"
- edit page
	- help list -> shows special tags, how-tos, etc.

- information flow
	- access request
	- xml list of all pages (including alternate spellings/names) ?
	- access restrictions/security issues marked on xml
	- php file_get_contents
	- php processing -> replaces special tags for html code
		- links, etc. -> xml is searched again for internal links
	- edit request (ajax)
	- xml node is searched for clearance level -> permission is granted
		- permission is not granted: message appears
	- in-browser text editor appears (textarea box) - special tags are left as is
		- javascript colour coding?
	- changes are made
	- files are uploaded
	- changes are previewed?
		- saved to a temp html file and displayed
