This section of my site is the wiki. For those of you who don't know what a wiki is, it's a special kind of website - one that is easy to edit. Wikipedia is a good example of a wiki.<br/>
It's good for either personal or group collaborative organization of thoughts and ideas.<br/>
I (Brandon Wong) have created this one (almost completely from scratch) as a learning experience, and hopefully so that I can benefit from its potential.<br/>
If I ever finish it, I'm going to use it to record my thoughts and ideas, as well as progress on personal projects. If I lose interest in and drop a project for a while (which almost always happens), with this site, I'll be able to pick up where I left off when I decide to come back to it (or so I hope). Also, should a group decide to organize an event or project together, this site can serve as one location for all the information, stored in a structured, non-chaotic way, and allows not only for any of the group to change the necessary information, but for everyone else to be able to see the updates the moment they access the wiki.<br/>
