Personal Wiki Project

I started this project to learn about how wikis are implemented.
It is PHP, and it stores flat-files for content.
It also has naive rudimentary version control.
Future features, and the skills needed to implement them (that I did not yet have) are listed on the wiki project page.

Work on this project stopped in early 2008, and has not continued since.
