&#xD;
I don't like small gadgets becoming all-use computers, like cell phones being able to do all sorts of things&#xD;
we need computers becoming small gadgets&#xD;
perhaps centralized computing power is better&#xD;
all functions can be performed by separate yet linked (wirelessly, probably) to the computer&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
each peripherals idea needs:&#xD;
[digital] drawings&#xD;
specifications&#xD;
to be bought or made&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
the ultimate peripherals collection would include:&#xD;
-well placed EM sensors&#xD;
-cameras&#xD;
-radio receivers&#xD;
-robotic arms&#xD;
-wireless camera (which automatically uploads photos/videos)&#xD;
-GPS receivers&#xD;
-satellite dishes&#xD;
-remote controlled unmanned recon vehicles&#xD;
